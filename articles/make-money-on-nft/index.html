	  <h2>NFT will create a lot of wealth to early investors</h2>

So here’s the useful information: do you know the new trend that’s gonna transform NFT universe? No? Keep reading.  </p>

	<article>
	  <h2>Okay, I am listening, so how do I make money on NFT?</h2>
	  <p>You have to find a good project. How do you find the good one? First of all, check out their website. How does it look like? Do they show NFT art they want to mint? How does the art look like? Is it a unique idea? Is it existing idea, but made in a different, perhaps unique way? How about the team? Do they have experience in crypto world? Developers know blockchain technology? Do they have budget for marketing activities? Very important thing is roadmap. Check it out carefully. Make sure to understand the goals of the NFT project. Do they plan DAO? What is the minting price? Is there a pre-sale for early birds? What price they expect to hit with their NFTs? What is the long term vision of the team? And most important – how does it sound to you? How does it make you feel? Do you believe this could be it?</p>

	  <h2>Don’t rush things, just prepare for investment</h2>
	  <p>What you really don’t want to do is to jump onboard and buy NFT right away. Give it some time, few hours, few days, learn more about the project, check out social media accounts of the project, join Discord channel, ask questions, read what other people write. You will get familiar with the project and make sure that you found the right one to invest into.</p>
	</article>
	<article>
	  <h2>Are you ready to make money on NFT?</h2>
	  <p>After a while you will either have a good feeling about the project or a bad feeling. If bad, look for other NFT project. If good, now is time to invest. Check out minting date and prepare yourself for investment. After you invest, it's a waiting game. If you want to flip for profit, you have to wait. Sometimes it can take couple of months. It depends on many factors. Don’t rush. Good things take time.</p>

	  <h2>Right now you’re gonna learn about that NFT project that’s gonna make you rich</h2>
	  <p>In the beginning of the article, I promised you that I'm gonna share with you NFT project that is gonna make 10x profit. Why Am I certain about this project? Because it’s a NFT Metaverse project. And it brings cats. NFTs of cats are hugely popular. And as far as I know, there is no other project that wants to bring cats into Metaverse. As early investor you can expect 10x profit. That means that if you invest 1,000 dollars, you will get 10,000 dollars after you flip it. But why make such a small investment? Let’s invest 10K. 100K. This project is gonna go parabolic. Discord is growing and marketing plan is at work, These guys know their game. They advertise on Facebook, they make partnerships with influencers on Youtube and much more.</p>
